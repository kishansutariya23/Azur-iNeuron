## 🚏 Azur Data Related Roles

- Database administrators
    - they manages DB, assigning permission to users, storing backup copies of data and restore data in the event of a failure
- Data engineers
    - They manage infrastructure and processes for data integration across the organization, applying data cleaning routines, identifying data governance rules, and implementing pipelines to transfer and transform data between system
- Data analysts
    - They explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts that enable organizations to make informed decisions.

## 🚏 Data Overview
<img src="../images/Data Over View.jpg">

## 🚏 Introduction to Data

- Data is a unit of information(it is collection of facts) that could be in the form of numbers, text, or machine code, images, videos, audio or physical(Handwriting)

- Data can be in form of
    - structured
        - row and columns
    - semi-structured
        - key-value pair
    - unstructured
        - email
        - audio
        - video
## 🚏 Data Documents
- A data document defines the collective form in which data exists
- common types
    - Datasets--> a logical grouping of data
    - DB--> Structured data that can be quickly access and searched
    - Datastore--> Unstructured or semi-structured data to housing data
    - Data Warehouse--> Structured or semi-structured data for creating reports and analytics
    - Notebooks--> Data that is arranged in pages, Designed for easy consumption

## 🚏 Data Sets
Data set is logical grouping of unit of data that generally are closely related and/or share the same data structure.
- google dataset search [platform for dataset]

## 🚏 Data Types
It is a single unit of data that tells a complier or interpreter(computer program) how data is intended to be used.
- In Python we have
    - Numeric [Integer, Complex number, float]
    - Dictionary
    - Boolean
    - Set
    - Sequence types [String, List, Tuple]

## 🚏 Schema VS Schemaless [Blueprint]
- Schema
    - A DB schema defines how data is organized within a relational DB but it not contains data.
    - This is inclusive of logical constraints such as table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities
    - EX:- SQL 
- Schemaless
    - In schemaless DB, information is stored in JSON-Style documents which can have varying sets of fields with different data types for each fields. 
    - So, a collection could look like this

        > {
        >     name:"ks",age:"23",interests:"DE"
        > }
        >
        > {
        >     name:"g",age:"23"
        > }

## 🚏 Query and Querying

> SELECT * FROM table_name
- Query : request for data results
- Querying : Act of performing the query

## 🚏 Batch VS Stream Processing
- Movement of data can be happen in either of these way
    - Batch  : These are schedule (based on the given time by person)
    - Stream : Live data@real-time (less than 1sec)

## Synchronus VS Asynchronous
## Non Relational Data
## Data Source
